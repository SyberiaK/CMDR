# CMDR - Custom Music Discs Records

**CMDR** is a standalone application that allows you to manage music discs in **Minecraft**. No need for converting your audio and making a resource pack for it - **CMDR** will do all this stuff really fast. You can switch music disc record to your own audio in few clicks even while playing the game.

## Setting up

At first launch of the application check "Minecraft directory path" in the settings. If it's incorrect - change to valid path.

While in game, don't forget to enable *"CMDR_RP"* resource pack so the changes will be applied.
